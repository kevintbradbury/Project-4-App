##Background:
The problem with most travel apps is they don’t always help sum up the journeys you’ve had and present them to your family, friends, co-workers. Everything remains in the digital world until we run out space. Most “Gen-Xers” and “Millenials” likely post their photos on Facebook or Instagram but those photos never make it to relatives or friends. iOS’s AirPrint functionality has been spotty and browsing over a printing tutorial for Android reminds me of the earlier days of Windows. Then there’s the frustration of dealing with your printer. Your friends don’t have time or patience for your printer problems and seeing those sketchy, b&w photos gives her flashback to “the war” or something traumatic. There’s a reason Gutenberg became so famous! Anyways, my point being that you take care of the picture/note making and let the professionals take care of the printing.

##Goals:
The goal behind this app is to pool all your documents and go back to analog. Pool all your pictures and notes together, the app will prompt you several different options (i.e. B/W book, how many pictures per page, text alignment, etc.), then it will send all this info to a 3rd party publisher who will print your book. If you have videos or audio from the trip, you can combine them to create a video or audio DVD. 

**Recommendations:** maybe separate site for videos? Wordpress? Dropbox?

##Research Questions:
How are they sharing their photos?
What percentage of people are printing photos from their phone? Or how often?
If they’re printing, how do they currently print them?
How do they share their videos?
What percentage are making DVDs? 
If they’re making them, how do they currently make their DVDs?

Methodology:

##Participants:
The focus is mainly on people who primarily take photos with their mobile device(phone or tablet) but often print their photos/want to print their photos.

Schedule:

##Script:
Device Usage: What device do you primarily take photos with?
Sharing: How do currently share those photos with friends and family?
Demographics: What percentage of your photos do you print or make hardcopies of?
If you print photos from your mobile device, what method do you use to print them?
What factors determine the method you use to share those photos?
